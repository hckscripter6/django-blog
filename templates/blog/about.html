	<h2>About Hunter Krieger</h2>
	<p>I'm web developer, game designer, musician, bibliophile and blogger in his early 20's, trying to create and build things both economically valuable and/or intrinsically satisfying just to pass the time constructively before my mind and body gives out.</p>
	
	<p>I've picked web development over the past 4 years (on and off) using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python etc...  and so far I've built a number of websites for others and myself (Including this one.  Also see <a href="http://www.brineyconstructionservices.com">brineyconstructionservices.com</a> and <a href="http://www.winamacpowershow.com">www.winamacpowershow.com</a>) </p>
	
	<p>I'm an obsessive reader who reads psychology, history, economics, video games, music etc. and my goal is to read a book a week and write about it.   I will fall short many times but it's a good goal to shoot for.</p>
	
	<p>I'm a musician who has played guitar and piano for about a decade.  I'm not a musical prodigy but I know my scales, chords, arpeggios, progressions etc. and can play by ear.</p>
	
	<p>I'm a game designer in learning who has been obsessed with video games as an art, a business and a science ever since I bought and Xbox One console 2 years ago.  I am currently using Unity and C# to build my own video games.  It's difficult but fun! </p>
	
	<p>So thank you for tuning into hckrieger.com. If need be then contact me by email at <strong><a href="mailto:hunterk31@hotmail.com" target="_top"> hunterk31@hotmail.com</a></strong> and I'll look forward to hearing from you!</p>
